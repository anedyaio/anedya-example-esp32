# Room Monitoring - ESP32+DHT (Submit-Log) (http)



This Arduino sketch allows you to submit your device log to the Anedya.

> [!WARNING]
> This code is for hobbyists for learning purposes. Not recommended for production use!!

### Code Set-Up

1. Replace `<PHYSICAL-DEVICE-UUID>` with your 128-bit UUID of the physical device.
2. Replace `<CONNECTION-KEY>` with your connection key, which you can obtain from the node description.
3. Set up your WiFi credentials by replacing `SSID` and `PASSWORD` with your WiFi network's SSID and password.

> [!NOTE] 
> This example utilizes `Anedya Root CA 3 (ECC - 256)(Pem format)` for establishing a secure connection to the Anedya. If you opt to use an `Anedya Root CA 1 (RSA - 2048)` certificate instead, please ensure that you provide the necessary additional certificate details regarding the RSA certificate before initiating the connection.

### Usages 

To submit the the log, use : 
```
anedya_submitLog("<REQUEST-ID>","<LOG-MESSAGE>");
```


## Dependencies

### ArduinoJson

This repository contains the ArduinoJson library, which provides efficient JSON parsing and generation for Arduino and other embedded systems. It allows you to easily serialize and deserialize JSON data, making it ideal for IoT projects, data logging, and more.

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "ArduinoJson".
4. Click on the ArduinoJson entry in the list.
5. Click the "Install" button to install the library.
6. Once installed, you can include the library in your Arduino sketches by adding `#include <ArduinoJson.h>` at the top of your sketch.

### Timelib

The `timelib.h` library provides functionality for handling time-related operations in Arduino sketches. It allows you to work with time and date, enabling you to synchronize events, schedule tasks, and perform time-based calculations.

To include the `timelib.h` library:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "Time".
4. Click on the ArduinoJson entry in the list(`Time by Michael Margolis`).
5. Click the "Install" button to install the library.
6. Once installed, you can include the library in your Arduino sketches by adding `#include <TimeLib.h>` at the top of your sketch.
