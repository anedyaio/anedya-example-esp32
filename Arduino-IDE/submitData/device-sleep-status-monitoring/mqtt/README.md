# Device Sleep Status Monitoring with Anedya (MQTT)


This Arduino sketch allows you to connect your device to a WiFi network and send device sleep status data to the Anedya platform.

> [!NOTE]
> The objective of this project is to provide a clear and practical example demonstrating how to utilize the Anedya platformâ€™s status data submission feature. It aims to help developers effectively integrate the status data type into their IoT applications.

> [!WARNING]
> This code is for hobbyists for learning purposes. Not recommended for production use!!

## Set up project in Anedya console

Following steps outline the overall steps to setup a project. You can read more about the steps [here](https://docs.anedya.io/essentials/concepts/)

1. Create account and login
2. Create new project.
3. Create a status variables: `deviceSleepStatus`.
4. Create a node (e.g., for home- Room1 or Device1).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Variable Identifier is essential; fill it accurately.

## Code Set-Up

1. Replace `<PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ID>` with your 128-bit UUID of the physical device.
2. Replace `<CONNECTION_KEY>` with your connection key, which you can obtain from the node details page.
3. Set up your WiFi credentials by replacing `YOUR_WIFI_SSID` and `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD` with your WiFi network's SSID and password.

> [!NOTE] 
> This example utilizes `Anedya Root CA 3 (ECC - 256)(Pem format)` for establishing a secure connection to the Anedya. If you opt to use an `Anedya Root CA 1 (RSA - 2048)` certificate instead, please ensure that you provide the necessary additional certificate details regarding the RSA certificate before initiating the connection.

## Usage

1. Enable your mobile or system hotspot.
2. Upload the provided code to your device using your preferred IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to observe the device logs.
4. Once connected to the WiFi network, the device will automatically send its sleep/wake status to the Anedya platform.


## Dependencies

### ArduinoJson

This repository contains the ArduinoJson library, which provides efficient JSON parsing and generation for Arduino and other embedded systems. It allows you to easily serialize and deserialize JSON data, making it ideal for IoT projects, data logging, and more.

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "ArduinoJson".
4. Click on the ArduinoJson entry in the list.
5. Click the "Install" button to install the library.
6. Once installed, you can include the library in your Arduino sketches by adding `#include <ArduinoJson.h>` at the top of your sketch.

### PubSubClient
The PubSubClient library provides a client for doing simple publish/subscribe messaging with a server that supports MQTT. It allows you to easily publish and subscribe to topics, making it ideal for IoT projects, data logging, and more.

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "PubSubClient".
4. Click on the PubSubClient by Nick O'Leary entry in the list.
5. Click the "Install" button to install the library.
6. Once installed, you can include the library in your Arduino sketches by adding `#include <PubSubClient.h>` at the top of your sketch.


### Timelib

The `timelib.h` library provides functionality for handling time-related operations in Arduino sketches. It allows you to work with time and date, enabling you to synchronize events, schedule tasks, and perform time-based calculations.

To include the `timelib.h` library:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "Time".
4. Click on the ArduinoJson entry in the list(`Time by Michael Margolis`).
5. Click the "Install" button to install the library.
6. Once installed, you can include the library in your Arduino sketches by adding `#include <TimeLib.h>` at the top of your sketch.
