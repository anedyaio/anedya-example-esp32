# Location Tracking (mqtt)

This Arduino sketch allows you to send real time location of your device to the anedya server.

> [!WARNING]
> This code is for hobbyists for learning purposes. Not recommended for production use!!

## Set-Up Project in Anedya Dashboard

Following steps outline the overall steps to setup a project. You can read more about the steps [here](https://docs.anedya.io/getting-started/quickstart/#create-a-new-project)

1. Create account and login
2. Create new project.
3. Create geo-coordinate variables: like-myCar.
4. Create a node (e.g., for car1).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Variable Identifier is essential; fill it accurately.

## Hardware Set-Up


### Code Set-Up

1. Replace `<PHYSICAL-DEVICE-UUID>` with your 128-bit UUID of the physical device.
2. Replace `<CONNECTION-KEY>` with your connection key, which you can obtain from the node description.
3. Set up your WiFi credentials by replacing `SSID` and `PASSWORD` with your WiFi network's SSID and password.
4. Specify the pin number connected to the Tx and Rx pin of gps module.

## Usage

1. Connect your device to a WiFi network.
2. Upload this code to your device.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the device's output.


## Dependencies


### TinyGPSPlus.h

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "tinygpsplus".
4. Click on the ArduinoJson entry in the list.
5. Click the "Install" button to install the library.
6. Once installed, you can include the library in your Arduino sketches by adding `#include <TinyGPSPlus.h>` at the top of your sketch.


### ArduinoJson

This repository contains the ArduinoJson library, which provides efficient JSON parsing and generation for Arduino and other embedded systems. It allows you to easily serialize and deserialize JSON data, making it ideal for IoT projects, data logging, and more.

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "ArduinoJson".
4. Click on the ArduinoJson entry in the list.
5. Click the "Install" button to install the library.
6. Once installed, you can include the library in your Arduino sketches by adding `#include <ArduinoJson.h>` at the top of your sketch.

### Timelib

The `timelib.h` library provides functionality for handling time-related operations in Arduino sketches. It allows you to work with time and date, enabling you to synchronize events, schedule tasks, and perform time-based calculations.

To include the `timelib.h` library:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "Time".
4. Click on the ArduinoJson entry in the list(`Time by Michael Margolis`).
5. Click the "Install" button to install the library.
6. Once installed, you can include the library in your Arduino sketches by adding `#include <TimeLib.h>` at the top of your sketch.
