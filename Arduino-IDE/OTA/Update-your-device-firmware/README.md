# Update-your-device-firmware - Example

The ability to update the firmware of IoT devices remotely is a critical feature for modern IoT hardware. This process, known as Over The Air (OTA) Updates, allows device manufacturers to easily push new firmware to their devices without physically accessing them. This not only reduces the maintenance cost of the devices but also helps to ensure that the devices are always up to date with the latest features and security patches.

# [Anedya OTA Service](https://docs.anedya.io/features/ota/)

Using Anedya, you can deploy and manage OTA Updates for thousands of devices. You can target specific groups of devices, roll out in a phased manner, and even automatically abort if something goes wrong.
