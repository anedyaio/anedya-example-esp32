This repository contains example projects for the ESP32 microcontroller utilizing the Anedya APIs. Anedya is a comprehensive cloud platform that offers Platform as a Service (PaaS) for IoT applications. It covers all aspects, including device lifecycle management, data storage, alerts, and data aggregation in a single platform. Anedya simplifies the integration of IoT hardware with the server and eliminates the burden of IoT cloud infrastructure development and management.

## Examples Included:

The examples demonstrate how to utilize Anedya with Esp32 microcontroller serise:

- Data submission and visualization on the Anedya cloud via HTTPS.
- Data submission and visualization on the Anedya cloud via MQTT.
- Submission of device logs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples:

1. Choose the code, create the .ino file, and open it in the Arduino IDE.
2. Fill in your Wi-Fi credentials, physical device ID, and connection key (obtained from the dashboard).
3. Select the Board and Port number.
4. Upload the code.
